<h2 align="center">Help - DNS Server</h2>

<p>This option will generate the rules that will allow inbound DNS
queries.  These are UDP queries to port 53.  It will also generate a
rule in the tcp_inbound chain to allow inbound tcp packets to port 53.
However, this rule is commented by default.  DNS queries are typically
UDP and that's the most commonly used protocol.  However, if you need to
enable zone transfers, you will need to allow TCP connections.  You can
simply uncomment the rule in the tcp_inbound chain.  However, you may
wish to tweak it so only those servers you wish to allow to perform zone
transfers are allowed in through the firewall.</p>
