<h2 align="center">Help - Passive FTP</h2>

<p>With passive FTP, the server provides a port to the client
and allows the client to initiate the connection rather
than initiating the connection with the client from the data port.
Web browsers and clients operating behind a firewall generally
use passive ftp transfers.  A general purpose FTP server
will need to support passive FTP requests.</p>

<p>However, by default an FTP server will select a port from the entire
range of high ports.  It is not particularly safe to open all
high ports.  Fortunately, that range can be restricted.  This
firewall presumes that the range has been restricted to a specific
selected range.  That range must also be configured in the ftp
server.</p>

<p>Instructions for specifying the port range for the wu-ftpd server
can be found here:</p>
