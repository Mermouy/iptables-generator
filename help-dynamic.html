<h2 align="center">Help - Static or Dynamic Address</h2>

<p>A computer has a <i>static address</i> on the Internet if the address
is manually added to the configuration and never changes.  If you have a
static IP address, select this option.  You will be prompted for
an IP address after you click the Generate Firewall! button.</p>

<p>If your computer receives its Internet address dynamically from a
provider, it has a <i>dynamic address</i> instead. Most computers that
connect to the Internet do so dynamically. DSL and cable broadband
connections generally use DHCP. Dial-up connections typically use PPP or
SLIP. All of these options are types of dynamic IP address
assignment.</p>
