<h1 align="center">IPTABLES in the Linux 2.4 Kernel</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is intended to provide a brief overview of
<strong>iptables</strong>, the concepts involved, and the manner in
which those concepts are implemented in this Firewall Generator.
IPTables replaces IPChains as the firewall of choice in the 2.4 linux
kernel.  IPChains is a <i>stateless</i> firewall.  It examines each
packet as a separate entity and each packet must therefore have a rule
associated with it.  IPTables is a <i>stateful</i> firewall.  It tracks
the state of a connection during its life.  Therefore each packet can be
associated with a state.  Either it is attempting to establish a NEW
connection, it is part of an ESTABLISHED connection or RELATED to a
connection, or the packet is in an INVALID state.  A stateless firewall
can be bypassed if an allowed protocol is discerned.  A stateful
firewall, by comparison, detects that the packet is not part of an
ongoing session and can be configured to prevent entry to the packet.  A
stateful firewall is therefore more secure than a stateless firewall.
Since many of the rules can rely on the state of the packet, a stateful
firewall generally requires fewer rules than a stateless firewall.  This
reduces the chances of human error as well.</p>

<p>An iptables firewall consists of several tables, each with a default
policy and builtin chains of rules.  Further rule chains can optionally
be created in each table.  Different tables and chains are traversed
according to the source and destination of the packet. A packet that is
received via a network interface on the system goes through a sequence
of steps before it is handled locally or forwarded to another host.</p>

<h2>Table Descriptions</h2>

<h3>filter Table</h3>

<p>The filter table is the default table for any rule. It is where the
bulk of the work in an iptables firewall occurs. Avoid filtering in any
other table as it may not work. It has three commonly used builtin
chains.  Those chains are INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD.  Packets destined
for the host traverse the INPUT chain.  Packets created by the host to
send to another system traverse the OUTPUT chain.  Packets received by
the host that are destined for another host traverse the FORWARD
chain.</p>

<h3>nat Table</h3>

<p>The <i>Network Address Translation</i> or nat table is used to
translate the source or destination field in packets.  A system with a
static IP should use Source Network Address Translation (snat) since it
uses fewer system resources.  However, iptables also supports hosts with
a dynamic connection to the Internet with a <i>masquerade</i> feature.
Masquerade uses the current address on the interface for address
translation.<p>

<h3>mangle table</h3>

<p>The mangle table is used to alter certain fields in the headers of IP
packets.  It can be used to change the <i>Time to Live</i> or TTL,
change the <i>Type of Service</i> or TOS field, or mark packets for
later filtering.</p>

<h2>Packet Path</h2>

<h3>Forwarded Packets</h3>

<p>A packet that is intended for another host is called a forwarded
packet. It first passes through the PREROUTING chain in the mangle
table. It then traverses the PREROUTING chain in the nat table. This is
where dnat rules are applied. The packet then traverses the FORWARD
chain in the filter table. This is the only chain where filtering rules
should be applied to the packet. The packet then passes to the
POSTROUTING chain in the nat table. In this chain, snat and masquerading
rules are applied.  The packet then passes out the outgoing
interface.</p>

<h3>Received Packets</h3>

<p>Packets addressed to the localhost first traverse the PREROUTING
chain in the mangle table.  Next they pass through the PREROUTING chain
in the nat table.  This is where dnat rules are applied.  After the dnat
rules, a routing decision must be made.  If the packet is really
intended for the localhost, the INPUT chain in the filter table is
traversed.  All filtering is done in this chain.  Packets that are
accepted are then passed to the local process or application for which
it is intended.</p>

<h3>Sent Packets</h3>

<p>Packets that are generated on the localhost first traverse the OUTPUT
chain of the mangle table.  They then pass through the OUTPUT chain of
the nat table.  Next, they pass through the OUTPUT chain of the filter
table.  Once the packet has passed those chains, the system must
determine where the packet should be routed.  Once that decision is
made, the packet traverses the POSTROUTING chain in the nat table.  This
where snat and masquerading rules are applied.  The packet then passes
through the appropriate network interface.</p>

<h2>Firewall Generator</h2>

<p>The firewall scripts generated by this program use several
conventions. Filter table rules are mostly divided among several
user-defined rule chains. This is intended to make the firewall easier
to follow and to minimize the number of rules each individual packet
must traverse.  Bad packets are defined as packets in an INVALID state
or any packets other than syn packets that are in a NEW state.  Packets
that are in an ESTABLISHED or RELATED state are accepted.  They are part
of an ongoing session.  Inbound TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets are passed to
a separate chains to determine if they should be accepted.  By default,
they are accepted from the internal interface and dropped from the
external interface.  TCP requests from the internal network for forwarding
are passes through an outbound chain to see if it should be refused.  By
default, those requests are accepted.

<h2>Redhat installation instructions</h2>

<p><ol>
<li>Ensure that ipchains will not automatically start.<br />
   chkconfig --level 0123456 ipchains off<br />
   This will make sure that the ipchains init.d script
   is not linked to an S file in any of the rc directories.</li>

<li>Stop ipchains if it's running.<br />
   service ipchains stop</li>

<li>Execute lsmod to see if the ipchains kernel module is still loaded.
   If it is, use rmmod to unload it.</li>

<li>Have the system link the iptables init.d startup script into run states
   2, 3, and 5.<br />
   chkconfig --level 235 iptables on</li>

<li>Save this script and execute it to load the ruleset from this
file. You may need to run the dos2unix command on it to remove carraige returns.</li>

<li>Save the ruleset to /etc/sysconfig/iptables.  This can be done two
ways.<br />
   service iptables save<br />
   iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables</li>

<li>The ruleset will be restored by the /etc/init.d/iptables script on
boot.</li>

</ol></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The /etc/init.d/iptables script can be modified to run this script
instead.  If you do so, save a copy so you can reapply your modifications
after upgrading the iptables package.  The advantage of using this script for
the ongoing operation of the firewall is it gives you greater control over
the modules and rulesets used.  The above is simpler, however.</p>
