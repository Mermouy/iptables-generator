<h2 align="center">IPTables-Tutorial</h2>

<p>A closer look at the ideas and approaches gleaned from <i>Oskar
Andreasson's IPTables-Tutorial</i> is warranted. His tutorial
influenced the direction of the Easy Firewall Generator more than any
other single work. That's not surprising. The <i>IPTables-Tutorial</i>
was one of the first works produced after the original netfilter HOWTOs.
It has significantly impacted many subsequent works.</p>

<p>The three most significant influences on Easy Firewall Generator
are listed below.</p>

<p><ul>

<li>The basic idea of using separate chains for each type of packet is
presented in the <i>iptables-tutorial</i>. This generator does not
implement it exactly the same way and further applies the concept to
outbound packets traversing the FORWARD chain, but the 
<i>iptables-tutorial</i> is the original source of the idea.</li>

<li>The idea of dropping NEW tcp packets that are not flagged as SYN
packets is one I found only in the <i>iptables-tutorial</i>. Although I
altered the manner in which it was invoked, I incorporated the general
concept into this generator.</li>

<li>The style of writing and organizing iptables rules used in the
<i>iptables-tutorial</i> is, in my opinion, the clearest and easiest to
read of all the styles I've seen. As such, I adopted that style for use
in this generator.</li>

</ul></p>

<p>If you have questions or issues with iptables that are not addressed
by this generator, the <i>IPTables-Tutorial</i> is the best starting
point for additional research.  A link to it is maintained in the
Resources page.</p>
