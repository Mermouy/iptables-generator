<h2 align="center">Help - Block Outbound Services</h2>

<p>This option exists if you wish to prevent your firewall from
forwarding requests from internal systems for specific services to the
Internet.  This will effectively disable that service for internal
systems, so use this option only if you wish to limit Internet access
for your internal users.  If the option is selected, a number of common
services are displayed.  At least one service must be selected for the
firewall to successfully generate.</p>
