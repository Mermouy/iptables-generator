<p>
The default policy for a firewall generated by this program drops
requests rather than rejecting them.  As a rule, that works fine.
However, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) servers typically send an ident
request when a client attempts to connect.  If the client does not
explicitly reject (or accept) the request, the server waits until it
times out.  That's obviously a problem.
</p>

<p>
Selecting this option causes the firewall to create the rules to explicitly
reject all requests to the ident port (113).  It also provides an alternative,
commented rule to accept the requests if you wish to experiment with that
option.  Note that if you are applying this script to a gateway, the stock identd
daemon included in most linux distributions is not sophisticated enough.
There are other ident deamons that can.  One such is oidentd available at:
